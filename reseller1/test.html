<h2 class="Docs-Heading-2" id="about-this-guide">About This Guide</h2>
<p>This guide provides the information required to integrate with our
Payment Gateway and gives a very basic example of code for doing so It
is expected that you have some experience in server-side scripting with

<h2 id="integration-methods">Integration Methods</h2>
<p>There are three methods of integration provided to process your
transactions through the Gateway, allowing for different levels of
control and communication from your website.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-integration">Hosted Integration</h3>
<p>The Hosted Integration method makes it easy to add secure payment
processing to your ecommerce business, using our Hosted Payment Pages
(HPP). You can use this method if you do not want to collect and store
Cardholder data.</p>
<p>The Hosted Integration method works by redirecting the Customer to
our Gateway’s Hosted Payment Page, which will collect the Customer’s
payment details and process the payment before redirecting the Customer
back to a page on your website, letting you know the payment outcome.
This allows you the quickest path to integrating with the Gateway.</p>
<p>The standard Hosted Payment Page is designed to be shown in a
lightbox over your website and styled with logos and colours to match.
Alternatively, you can arrange for fully customised Hosted Payment Pages
to be produced that can match your website’s style and layout. These
fully customised pages are usually provided using a browser redirect,
displaying full-page in the browser, or can be displayed embedded in an
iframe on your website.</p>
<p>For greater control over the customisation of the payment page, our
Gateway offers the use of Hosted Payment Fields, where only the
individual input fields collecting the sensitive Cardholder data are
hosted by the Gateway while the remainder of the payment form is
provided by your website. These Hosted Payment Fields fit seamlessly
into your payment page and can be styled to match your payment fields.
When your payment form is submitted to your server, the Gateway will
submit a payment token representing the sensitive card data it collected
and your webserver can then use the Direct Integration to process the
payment without ever being in contact with the collected Cardholder
data. For more information, please refer to our Hosted Payment Fields
SDK Guide.</p>
<h3 id="direct-integration">Direct Integration</h3>
<p>The Direct Integration works by allowing you to keep the Customer on
your system throughout the checkout process, collecting the Customer’s
payment details on your own secure server before sending the collected
data to our Gateway for processing. This allows you to provide a
smoother, more complete checkout process to the Customer.</p>
<p>In addition to basic sales processing, the Direct Integration can be
used to perform other actions such as refunds and cancellations, which
can provide a more advanced integration with our Gateway.</p>
<h3 id="batch-integration">Batch Integration</h3>
<p>The Batch Integration is an enhancement to the Direct Integration,
allowing you to send multiple transactions in a single request and
monitor their status. This is useful if you wish to capture multiple
transactions or collect multiple payments – for example, collecting
subscription charges or loan repayments.</p>
<p>In addition to basic sales processing, the Batch Integration can be
used to perform other actions, such as refunds and cancellations, which
can provide a more advanced integration with our Gateway.</p>
<p>Unlike the Hosted and Direct Integrations, the Batch Integration does
not process transactions sent to it immediately. Instead, the Gateway
queues these transactions to be processed and returns a batch reference
number which can be used to download a file that contains the current
status of the transactions.</p>
<p>Batch Processing does not support transactions that require Customer
interaction such as 3-D Secure transactions, or alternative payment
methods with interactive Wallet or Checkout pages.</p>
<h2 id="integration-libraries">Integration Libraries</h2>
<p>We can provide a range of libraries to help you to integrate with the
Gateway.</p>
<p>These libraries include simple server-side classes in many popular
programming languages, through to client-side scripts to help with the
integration of the Hosted Payment Page or Hosted Payment Fields.</p>
<p>For more information about these libraries, please refer to appendix
A-1.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance</h2>
<p>Each method requires a different level of server security and
compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
DSS).</p>
<p>If you use Hosted Payment Pages with the Hosted Integration or Hosted
Payment Fields with the Direct or Batch Integrations, then your
webserver does not need an SSL certificate and you require the lowest
level of PCI DSS compliance.</p>
<p>If your website collects and/or stores sensitive Cardholder data,
such as the card number (PAN) or card security code (CVV/CV2), then your
webserver must have an SSL certificate and serve all payment forms using
HTTPS. You will also need a higher level of PCI DSS compliance and to
complete a PCI validation form annually.</p>
<p>For more information, please see
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="integration-details"><br />
Integration Details</h2>
<h3 id="http-requests">HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>A request can be sent to the Gateway by submitting a HTTP POST
request to the integration URL provided.</p>
<p>The request should have a Content-Type:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded HTTP header and the request should be
name, value pairs URL encoded as per RFC 1738.</p>
<p>Example URL encoding:</p>
<p>merchantID=100001&amp;action=SALE&amp;type=1&amp;amount=1001&amp;currencyCode=826&amp;countryCode=826&amp;transactionUnique=55f6db1c81d95&amp;orderRef=Test+purchase&amp;customerPostCode=NN17+8YG&amp;responseCode=0&amp;responseMessage=AUTHCODE%3A350333&amp;state=captured&amp;xref=15091702MG47WN32MM88LPK&amp;cardNumber=4929+4212+3460+0821&amp;cardExpiryDate=1215</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that the field names are cAsE
sEnSiTiVe</strong>.</em></p>
<p>The response will use the same URL encoding and return the request
fields in addition to any dedicated response field. If the request
contains a field that is also intended as a response field, then any
incoming request value will be overwritten by the correct response
value.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-http-requests">Hosted HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>When using the Hosted Integration, the request must be sent from the
Customer’s web browser as the response will be a HTML Hosted Payment
Page (HPP), used to collect the Customer’s details. The format of the
request is designed so that it can be sent using a standard HTML form
with the data in hidden form fields. The browser will then automatically
encode the request correctly according to
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.</p>
<p>When the Hosted Payment Page has been completed and the payment
processed, the Customer’s browser will be automatically redirected to
the URL provided via the <strong>redirectURL</strong> field. The
response will be returned to this page in
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format, using a HTTP POST request.</p>
<p>If the request contains a field that is also intended as a response
field, then any incoming request value will be overwritten by the
correct response value.</p>
<p>An example of a Hosted Integration request is provided in appendix
A-21.1 and sample code is provided in appendix A-22.1.</p>
<h3 id="direct-http-requests">Direct HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>When using the Direct Integration, the response will be received in
the same URL encoded format, unless a <strong>redirectURL</strong> field
is provided.</p>
<p>If a <strong>redirectURL</strong> field is provided, then the
response will be a HTML page designed to redirect a browser to the URL
provided, using a HTTP POST request containing the response. This allows
you to collect the Cardholder’s payment details on your own server,
using a HTML form which POSTs to the Direct Integration, which then
effectively POSTs the results back to this URL your webserver, where you
can display the transaction outcome.</p>
<p>If the request contains a field that is also intended as a response
field, then any incoming request value will be overwritten by the
correct response value.</p>
<p>An example of a Direct Integration request is provided in appendix
A-21.1 and sample code is provided in appendix A-22.1.</p>
<h3 id="batch-http-requests">Batch HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>When using the Batch Integration, a single HTTP POST request can
contain multiple individual requests using the multipart/mixed content
type with a boundary string specified. Within that main HTTP request,
each of the parts contains a nested Direct Integration HTTP request,
separated by the boundary string.</p>
<p>Each part should begin with a Content-Type:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded HTTP header and contain a single
Direct Integration HTTP request, as documented in section 1.5.3.</p>
<p>You can optionally specify a Content-Id HTTP header to identify each
part message uniquely; if not provided, the Gateway will assign a unique
id to each part. The Content-Id HTTP header is returned in the response.
The Gateway will not validate the uniqueness of any id provided. After
the mandatory Content-type and the optional <em>Content-Id</em> header,
two carriage return/line feed pairs must follow
(i.e. <em>\r\n\r\n</em>). Any deviation from this structure might lead
to the part being rejected or incorrectly interpreted. The part request
payload, formatted as a regular HTTP URL encoded request, must follow
the two-line breaks directly.</p>
<p>To reduce the size of large batch requests, the Gateway supports
compression using a Content-Encoding HTTP header with either a ‘gzip’ or
‘x-gzip’ value. This header can be provided in the main request or in
the part request or both.</p>
<p>An Authorization HTTP header can be used in the request to provide
the username and password of a Gateway Merchant Management System user
account. If correct, the batch details will be recorded as having been
submitted by that user; if invalid, then the request will fail and
respond with a 401 (Unauthorised) HTTP status code.</p>
<p>The Gateway will respond in the same manner as the request with a
multipart/mixed content type; each part is the response to one of the
requests in the batched request. In addition, the response will contain
a standard Location HTTP header, providing a URL from which further
batch update responses can be downloaded; and a standard
Content-Disposition header, allowing a browser to download the response
to a file. If the request contained an Authorization HTTP header, then
the response will contain an X-P3-Token HTTP header containing an
authentication token that can be sent in future requests instead of the
username and password. The authentication token has a limited life span,
but each future request will return a new token and thus effectively
rejuvenate the token’s life.</p>
<p>Like the parts in the request, each response part contains a HTTP
response, including headers and body. Each response part is preceded by
a Content-Type HTTP header and Content-ID HTTP header. In addition, an
X-Transaction-ID HTTP header is added containing the requests
transaction id together with an X-Transaction-Response HTTP header
containing a textual description of the transaction processing
status.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>The Gateway will not process the transactions immediately but
will queue them up to process over time. The transactions may not be
processed in the order provided, so should not have interdependencies.
Transactions will only appear in the Merchant Management System when
they have been processed. The status of queued transaction is only
available by querying the status of the batch.</em></p>
<p>The current status of a batch can be queried at any time by issuing a
HTTP GET request to the URL provided in the initial responses Location
HTTP header.</p>
<p>An Authorization HTTP header must be provided in the status request,
containing either the username and password of a Gateway Merchant
Management System user account or an authentication token returned in
the batch submission response’s X-P3-Token HTTP header. If a valid
username and password or a valid token is provided, then the response
will be an updated version of the initial submission response providing
the current status of each transaction. The response will only contain
transactions that the authenticated user has permission to view.</p>
<p>An example of a Batch Integration request is provided in appendix
A-21.3 and sample code is provided in appendix A-22.3.1.</p>
<h3 id="handling-errors">Handling Errors</h3>
<p>When the Gateway is uncontactable due to a communications error, or
problem with the internet connection, you may receive a HTTP status code
in the 500 to 599 range. In this situation, you may want to retry the
transaction. If you do choose to retry a transaction, then we recommend
that you perform a limited number of attempts with an increasing delay
between each attempt.</p>
<p>If the Gateway is unavailable during a scheduled maintenance period,
you will receive a HTTP status code of 503 ‘Service Temporarily
Unavailable’. In this situation, you should retry the transaction after
the scheduled maintenance period has expired. You will be notified of
the times and durations of any such scheduled maintenance periods in
advance, by email, and given a time when transactions can be
reattempted.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing these errors, then we recommend you consider
the following steps as appropriate for the integration method being
used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the request is being sent to HTTPS and not HTTP. HTTP is
not supported and is not redirected.</p></li>
<li><p>Send transactions sequentially rather than concurrently.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your integration code with try/catch loops around
individual transactions to determine whether they were successful or not
and retry if required, based on the return code or HTTP status
returned.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the integration so that if one transaction fails, the
entire batch does not stop at that point – i.e. log the failure to be
checked and then skip to the next transaction rather than stopping
entirely.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="redirect-url">Redirect URL</h3>
<p>The <strong>redirectURL</strong> request field is used to provide the
URL of a webpage on your server.</p>
<p>When provided, the Gateway will respond with a HTML page designed to
redirect the Customer’s browser to the URL provided, using a HTTP POST
request containing the URL encoded response.</p>
<p>For the Hosted Integration, this will redirect the Customer from the
Hosted Payment Page back to this URL on your website.</p>
<p>For the Direct Integration, this allows you to collect the
Cardholder’s payment details on your own server using a HTML form that
POSTs to the Direct Integration. which then effectively POSTs the
results back to this URL on your webserver, where you can display the
transaction outcome. This usage is not recommended as it makes it harder
to sign the message.</p>
<p>The URL is mandatory for the Hosted Integration and optional for the
Direct Integration. It is not supported by the Batch Integration.</p>
<p>The <strong>redirectURL</strong> must be a fully qualified URL,
containing at least the scheme and host components.</p>
<h3 id="callback-url">Callback URL</h3>
<p>The <strong>callbackURL</strong> request field allows you optionally
to request that the Gateway sends a copy of the response to an
alternative URL. In this case, each response will then be POSTed to this
URL in addition to the normal response. This allows you to specify a URL
on a secure shopping cart or backend order processing system, which will
then fulfil any order associated with the transaction.</p>
<p>The URL is optional for both the Hosted Integration and the Direct
Integration. It is not supported by the Batch Integration.</p>
<p>The <strong>callbackURL</strong> must be a fully qualified URL,
containing at least the scheme and host components.</p>
<h3 id="field-formats">Field Formats</h3>
<p>Most integration field values are either numerical or textual; and
either free format or from a range of predetermined values. Some field
values are records or arrays of records.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, numerical values are whole integer values
with no decimal points. Textual values should use the UTF-8 character
set and will be automatically truncated if too long, unless stated
otherwise in the field’s description. Textual values may be
transliterated<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when sending to third parties such
as Acquirers but the original value is stored by Gateway and displayed
in the Merchant Management System.</p>
<p>Field values should use the following formats unless otherwise stated
in the field’s description:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 26%" />
<col style="width: 73%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Field Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Value Format</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Monetary Amounts</strong></td>
<td>Either major currency units by providing a value that includes a
single decimal point such as ’10.99’; or in minor currency units by
providing a value that contains no decimal points such as ‘1099’.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Timestamps</strong></td>
<td>Date in the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Dates</strong></td>
<td>Date in the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD’</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Country Codes</strong></td>
<td>Either the ISO-3166-1 2-letter, 3-letter or 3-digit code.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Currency Codes</strong></td>
<td>Either the ISO-4217 3-letter or 3-digit code.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Records</strong></td>
<td>Records can be provided using the <em>[XX]</em> notation, where
<em>XX</em> is the record’s field name (sub-field). Records can be
multi-dimensional or be sequentially indexed. For example: to send a
value for the sub-field <em>Y</em> in the integration field <em>X,</em>
use the field name <em>X[Y]</em>; however, to send a value for the
sub-field <em>Y</em> in the fourth record for integration field
<em>X,</em> then use the field name <em>X[4][Y]</em> etc. Boolean values
must be sent as ‘true’ or ‘false’ as detailed below.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Serialised Records</strong></td>
<td>Records can be sent as a JSON or URL serialised string. The first
character of the serialised string determines its format: ‘{‘ indicates
JSON format and anything else is assumed to be
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format with any boolean values sent as
‘true’ or ‘false’ as detailed below.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note: Nested records are useful when posting sub-fields direct from a
HTML FORM. However, unlike the main integration fields, a nested
record’s sub-fields are not sorted when constructing the signature and
are processed in the order received. Serialised records can overcome any
problems caused by a nested record’s fields being received in a
different order to that used when generating the signature.</p>
<p>Boolean value cannot be represented using
application/x-www-form-urlencoded and are therefore avoid where
possible. However, some nested records may require the passing of
boolean values where the data is sent to or originates from an external
provider. In such circumstances any nested records boolean values must
be url encoded as the strings ‘true’ and ‘false’ and not ‘1’ and ‘0’. If
the nested records are being sent in JSON serialised format, then normal
JSON boolean types can be used.</p>
<h2 id="authentication"><br />
Authentication</h2>
<p>All requests must specify which Merchant Account they are for, using
the <strong>merchantID</strong> request field. In addition to this, the
following security measures can be used:</p>
<h3 id="password-authentication">Password Authentication</h3>
<p>You can configure a password for each Merchant Account, using the
Merchant Management System (MMS). This password must then be sent in the
<strong>merchantPwd</strong> field in each request. If an incorrect
password is received by the Gateway, then the transaction will be
aborted and an error response is returned.</p>
<h3 id="message-signing">Message signing</h3>
<p>You can configure a signing secret phrase for each Merchant Account
using the Merchant Management System (MMS). When configured, each
request will need to be ‘signed’ by providing a
<strong>signature</strong> field containing a hash generated from the
combination of the serialised request and this signing secret phrase. On
receipt, the Gateway will then re-generate the hash and compare it with
the one sent. If the two hashes are different then the request received
must not be the same as that sent and so the contents must have been
tampered with and the transaction will be aborted and an error response
is returned.</p>
<p>The Gateway will also return hash of the response message in the
returned <strong>signature</strong> field, allowing you to create your
own hash of the response (minus the <strong>signature</strong> field)
and verify that the hashes match.</p>
<p><strong>Message signing maybe mandatory on some Merchant Accounts and
if so, the Merchant Management System will only allow the secret phrase
to be changed but not removed entirely.</strong></p>
<p>If message signing is enabled, then the data POSTed to any callback
URL will also be signed.</p>
<p>See appendix A-13 for information on how to create the hash.</p>
<h3 id="allowed-ip-addresses">Allowed IP addresses</h3>
<p>You can configure a list of IP addresses using the Merchant
Management System (MMS). Two different address lists can be configured,
one for standard requests, such as sales; and one for advanced requests,
such as refunds and cancellations. If a request is received from an
address other than those configured, then it will be aborted and an
error response is returned.</p>
<h2 id="supported-actions"><br />
Supported Actions</h2>
<p>All requests must specify what action they require the Gateway to
perform, using the <strong>action</strong> request field. The Direct and
Batch Integrations support all actions; however, the Hosted Integration
only supports the basic payment actions.</p>
<h3 id="sale">SALE</h3>
<p>This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation
for a sale from the Acquirer. A successful authorisation will reserve
the funds on the Cardholder’s account until the transaction is
settled.</p>
<p>The <strong>captureDelay</strong> field can be used to state whether
the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date.
For more details on delayed capture, refer to appendix A-10.</p>
<h3 id="verify">VERIFY</h3>
<p>This will create a new transaction and attempt to verify that the
card account exists with the Acquirer. The transaction will result in no
transfer of funds and no hold on any funds on the Cardholder’s account.
It cannot be captured and will not be settled. The transaction
<strong>amount</strong> must always be zero.</p>
<p>This transaction type is the preferred method for validating that the
card account exists and is in good standing; however, it cannot be used
to validate that it has sufficient funds.</p>
<h3 id="preauth">PREAUTH</h3>
<p>This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation
for a sale from the Acquirer. If authorisation is approved, then it is
immediately voided (where possible) so that no funds are reserved on the
Cardholder’s account. The transaction will result in no transfer of
funds. It cannot be captured and will not be settled.</p>
<p>This transaction type can be used to check whether funds are
available and that the account is valid. However, due to the problem
highlighted below, it is recommended that Merchants use the VERIFY
action when supported by their Acquirer.</p>
<h3 id="refund_sale">REFUND_SALE</h3>
<p>This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation
for a refund of a previous SALE from the Acquirer. The transaction will
then be captured and settled if and when appropriate. It can only be
performed on transactions that have been successfully settled. Up until
that point, a CANCEL or partial CAPTURE can be used, to refund or
partially refund the original SALE transaction. The previous SALE
transaction should be specified using the <strong>xref</strong>
field.</p>
<p>Partial refunds are allowed by specifying the <strong>amount</strong>
to refund. Any amount must not be greater than the original received
amount minus any already refunded amount. Multiple partial refunds may
be made while there is still a portion of the originally received amount
un-refunded.</p>
<p>The <strong>captureDelay</strong> field can be used to state whether
the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date.
For more details on delayed capture refer to appendix A-10.</p>
<p><em><strong>This action is not supported by the Hosted
Integration.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="refund">REFUND</h3>
<p>This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation
for a refund from the Acquirer. The transaction will then be captured
and settled if and when appropriate. This is an independent refund and
need not be related to any previous SALE. The amount is therefore not
limited by any original received amount.</p>
<p>The <strong>captureDelay</strong> field can be used to state whether
the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date.
For more details on delayed capture refer to appendix A-10.</p>
<p><em><strong>This action is not supported by the Hosted
Integration.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="capture"> CAPTURE</h3>
<p>This will capture an existing transaction, identified using the
<strong>xref</strong> request field, making it available for settlement
at the next available opportunity. It can only be performed on
transactions that have been authorised but not yet captured. An
<strong>amount</strong> to capture may be specified but must not exceed
the original amount authorised.</p>
<p>The original transaction must have been submitted with a
<strong>captureDelay</strong> value that prevented immediate capture and
settlement leaving the transaction in an authorised but un-captured
state. For more details on delayed capture refer to appendix A-10.</p>
<p><em><strong>This action is not supported by the Hosted
Integration.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="cancel">CANCEL</h3>
<p>This will cancel an existing transaction, identified using the
<strong>xref</strong> request field, preventing it from being settled.
It can only be performed on transactions, which have been authorised but
not yet settled, and it is not reversible. Depending on the Acquirer it
may not reverse the authorisation and release any reserved funds on the
Cardholder’s account. In such cases, authorisation will be left to
expire as normal releasing the reserved funds. This may take up to 30
days from the date of authorisation.</p>
<p><em><strong>This action is not supported by the Hosted
Integration.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="query">QUERY</h3>
<p>This will query an existing transaction, identified using the
<strong>xref</strong> request field, returning the original response.
This is a simple transaction lookup action.</p>
<p><em><strong>This action is not supported by the Hosted
Integration.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="new-transactions">New Transactions</h1>
<p>You can perform a new transaction, such as a sale, by sending a
request with the required action and transaction type together with
details about the order and payment method.</p>
